# Q3 Interfaces (Stubs Only)

This package defines interface stubs for Q3 integration work. It contains no implementation logic.

## Scope
- Proof provider/verifier interfaces
- Fee policy hook interface
- Chain finality provider interface
- Receipt verification interface
- Minimal types (bytes32, trace reference)

## Non-goals
- No runtime logic or concrete implementations
- No dependency from current demos or conformance runs

## Usage
These interfaces are placeholders for future integration and should raise `NotImplementedError` by default.
