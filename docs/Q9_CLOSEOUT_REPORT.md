# Q9 Testnet Alpha Closeout Report

## Purpose
Provide a factual closeout summary for Q9 Testnet Alpha after the release window.

## Scope
Testnet Alpha only.

## Non-Scope
No protocol semantic changes and no mainnet claims.

## Closeout Checklist (Facts)
- Canonical verification commands executed and green.
- Evidence bundles generated and deterministic for fixed inputs.
- Conformance report generated: nyx_conformance_report.json.
- UI and backend copy labeled Testnet Alpha, with no live operational claims.

## Evidence Artifacts
- nyx_conformance_report.json
- Deterministic evidence bundles and export zips from Q9 flows

## Final Status
- Go/No-Go status: TBD (facts only)
- Blocking items (if any): TBD

## Freeze / Change Control
- Q1–Q8 semantics remain sealed.
- Q9 closeout is documentation-only unless a zero-semantic patch is required with regression proof.
