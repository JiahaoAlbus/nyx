# NYX Pitch Deck (Slides)

## Slide 1: Title
**NYX: The Deterministic Portal Layer**
*Bridging Intent to Execution with Math, not Trust.*

## Slide 2: The "Frontend" Problem
-   Blockchains are trustless.
-   Frontends (Portals) are 100% trusted.
-   Hacks, phishing, and downtime happen here.
-   We need a "Layer 2.5" for Portals.

## Slide 3: Enter NYX
-   A deterministic state machine for off-chain apps.
-   Generates **Evidence**, not just JSON responses.
-   If the backend lies, the Evidence proves it.

## Slide 4: How It Works
1.  **User Signs Intent** -> NYX Gateway.
2.  **Gateway Executes** (Deterministic Python Engine).
3.  **Gateway Proves** -> Returns State Hash + Receipt.
4.  **Client Verifies** -> "Trust but Verify" in real-time.

## Slide 5: The Tech Stack (Live Today)
-   **Backend**: Python 3.10 (Deterministic, Type-Safe).
-   **Frontend**: React + iOS (Native WebBundle).
-   **Protocol**: JSON Evidence Bundles (Auditable).

## Slide 6: "No Fake Data"
-   We don't mock APIs.
-   We don't hide errors.
-   If the math doesn't check out, the app stops.
-   Safety over Convenience.

## Slide 7: Use Cases
-   **DeFi Portals**: Verifiable order books.
-   **Gaming**: Provably fair RNG and state.
-   **Social**: Signed, tamper-proof chat logs.

## Slide 8: Roadmap
-   **Now**: Testnet v1 (Local/Dev).
-   **Next**: Public Shared Testnet.
-   **Future**: Decentralized Sequencer Network.

## Slide 9: The Ask
-   Partnerships for Pilot Portals.
-   Grants for Core Infra Dev.

## Slide 10: Reproducibility
-   Don't trust this deck.
-   Run `scripts/nyx_verify_all.sh`.
-   Verify the code yourself.

## Slide 11: Team
-   [Founder Name/Bio]
-   Engineering-first. Security-obsessed.
