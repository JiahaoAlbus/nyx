# NYX Investor One-Pager

## Mission
To build the standard for **deterministic, verifiable portal infrastructure** that bridges the gap between user intent and on-chain execution, without centralized trust assumptions.

## The Problem
Web3 portals (frontends) are the weakest link. They are centralized, opaque, and often untrusted. Users sign transactions they don't understand, relying on web servers that can change logic at any time.

## The Solution: NYX
NYX is a **Proof-of-State** gateway.
-   **Deterministic**: Every action is reproducible.
-   **Verifiable**: Every response comes with a cryptographic Evidence Bundle.
-   **Transparent**: "No Fake Data" architecture ensures WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get).

## Technical Traction (Testnet Beta)
-   **v1 Core Live**: Python-based deterministic backend operational.
-   **Mobile Ready**: iOS Portal wrapper with native verification gates.
-   **Conformance**: v1 Ruleset defined and enforced by automated runners.
-   **Evidence**: Full trace generation for Audit/Forensics.

## Roadmap
-   **Q1 2026**: External Proof Package (Current) & Grant Applications.
-   **Q2 2026**: Public Testnet (Multi-node sequencer experiments).
-   **Q3 2026**: Developer SDK (Build your own portal on NYX).
-   **Q4 2026**: Mainnet Bridge & L2 Settlement integration.

## Funding Ask
We are seeking **Grants** and **Pre-Seed** partners to fund:
1.  **Security Audits**: Professional review of the determinism engine.
2.  **DevRel**: Documentation and SDK tooling for ecosystem growth.
3.  **Operations**: Hosting for public testnet nodes.
