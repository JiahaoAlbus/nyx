# Grants Strategy

## Definition
A **Grant** is non-dilutive funding provided to support open-source development, research, or public goods.

## Target Grant Angles

### 1. Determinism & Replayability
-   **Pitch**: "Building the standard for off-chain determinism."
-   **Target**: Foundations supporting verifiable computation (e.g., Ethereum Foundation, Optimism, specialized ZK grants).
-   **Deliverable**: A standalone Python library for deterministic state machines.

### 2. Conformance & Safety
-   **Pitch**: "No Fake Data - A new standard for frontend security."
-   **Target**: Security-focused grants (e.g., OpenZeppelin, Immunefi requests for tooling).
-   **Deliverable**: The `conformance-v1` runner and "No Fake Gates" specifications.

### 3. Modular Portal Services
-   **Pitch**: "Decentralized Frontends for DeFi."
-   **Target**: DeFi protocols needing better frontend censorship resistance.
-   **Deliverable**: Adapters to plug NYX into existing DeFi contracts.

## Application Template

### Project Name
NYX: The Deterministic Portal Layer

### Description
NYX is a testnet infrastructure that proves it is possible to build user-facing portals that are as verifiable as the blockchains they connect to.

### Milestones
1.  **M1 ($10k)**: Release External Proof Package (Docs + Scripts). **[DONE]**
2.  **M2 ($25k)**: Public Testnet Launch with multi-user support.
3.  **M3 ($50k)**: SDK release and first 3rd-party integration.

### Impact
Reduces phishing and frontend attacks by enabling users to cryptographically verify what they see on their screen matches the backend state.
