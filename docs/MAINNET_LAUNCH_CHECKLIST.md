## Non-Scope
- Any change to sealed Q1–Q3 semantics.
- Any new protocol semantics after freeze.

## Go/No-Go Criteria (Objective)
All items MUST be satisfied for Go:
- 0 Critical open issues AND 0 High open issues across audit, bounty, and internal tracking.
- Full test suite green with repo-standard command.
- Property tests green at repo PROPERTY_N.

- Determinism guards green.
- Audit pack complete and reviewed.
- Runbooks complete and reviewed.
- Key ceremony plan complete and reviewed.
- OPSEC model complete and reviewed.

## Evidence / Verification
Required commands:
- `python -m compileall packages/l0-identity/src`
- `python -m unittest discover -s packages/l0-identity/test -p "*_test.py" -v`

Record:
- Test output summary with counts.
- PROPERTY_N value used.
- Bounded explorer bounds and pass/fail.
- Conformance v3 report path.

## Q5 Additions (Additive Only)
- Router v1 receipt and replay tests MUST be green.
- Reference client output MUST be deterministic for identical seeds.
- Bug bounty and disclosure docs MUST be complete and current.
- Q5 audit reproduction commands MUST be available and verified.

## Freeze / Change Control
