# Q7 Artifact Index (Template)

Purpose
- Provide a consistent template for cataloging Q7 UI, SDK, and documentation artifacts.

Scope
- Q7 artifacts only; no protocol semantics are defined here.

Non-Scope
- Any protocol change or semantic change.

Template

| Path | Artifact Type | Purpose | Normative | Verification Command |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (path) | UI / SDK / Docs / Evidence | (one sentence) | Yes / No | (command or N/A) |

Freeze / Change Control
- This is a template only; it does not define protocol behavior.
