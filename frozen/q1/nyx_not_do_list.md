## 1. NYX will NOT treat wallets as identity

- Wallets are replaceable key containers
- Any design assuming “one wallet = one person” is invalid

---

## 2. NYX will NOT bind identity to real-world humans

- No KYC as a core requirement
- No assumption of natural-person continuity

---

## 3. NYX will NOT rely on human trust

- No admins with god-mode
- No emergency powers based on reputation or intent

> If trust is required, the design has failed

---

## 4. NYX will NOT offer zero-fee transactions

- Zero fees invite spam and abuse
- All state changes must incur a cost

---

## 5. NYX will NOT optimize UX at the cost of decentralization

---

## 6. NYX will NOT assume users are rational or benevolent

- The system must survive stupidity and malice
- Incentives must work under worst-case behavior

---

---

## 9. NYX will NOT allow irreversible power concentration

---

## 11. NYX will NOT enable reputation markets

- Credit cannot be bought, sold, or transferred

---

## 13. NYX will NOT allow silent rule changes

- No implicit upgrades
- No behavior changes without explicit governance action

---

## 14. NYX will NOT confuse censorship resistance with absence of rules

- Rules exist
- Enforcement is structural, not discretionary

---

## 15. NYX will NOT become a generalized everything-chain

- Scope is intentional
- Feature bloat is governance failure

---

## 16. NYX will NOT rely on narrative over mechanism

- No roadmap promises without enforceable constraints

---

## 17. NYX will NOT protect users from their own decisions

- No paternalistic rollbacks
- No moral hazard guarantees

---

## 18. NYX will NOT externalize system costs

- Users who consume resources must pay
- Hidden subsidies are technical debt

---

## 19. NYX will NOT sacrifice auditability for speed

- Fast but opaque systems are invalid
- Transparency is non-negotiable

---

## 20. NYX will NOT evolve without constitutional alignment
