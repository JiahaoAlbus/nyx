# NYX Constitution v1 (Draft)

> This Constitution is not a manifesto.
> It is a **system-level constraint**.
>
> NYX is not designed to be friendly.
> NYX is designed to be **structurally un-abusable**.

---

## Article 0 — Purpose

NYX exists for one and only one reason:

> **To construct a sustainable digital order that does not rely on human goodwill.**

NYX does not aim to:
- save the world
- educate users
- replace nation-states

NYX does exactly one thing:

> **Power is locked into structure, not entrusted to people.**

---

## Article I — Identity

### I.1 Identity ≠ Human

- NYX does not recognize natural persons as first-class system objects
- The only valid subject inside the system is a **NYX Identity**
- Identity is a structured set of permissions, not a projection of personality

**Implications:**
- Humans may disappear
- Identities must be transferable
- Identities must be freezable
- Identities must be inheritable
- Identities must be destructible

---

### I.2 Identity Is Composable

- One entity may control multiple identities
- One identity may serve multiple purposes
- Identities are not "real" or "fake"

> Identities are only **valid** or **invalid**

---

## Article II — Wallet

### II.1 Wallet ≠ Identity

- A wallet is a key-management interface
- A wallet has no social or legal meaning
- Losing a wallet does not equal losing an identity

> Any system that treats wallets as identity has already failed by design

---

### II.2 Wallets Are Replaceable Components

- Wallets may be upgraded, migrated, or rotated
- Wallets must never directly determine:
  - governance power
  - credit
  - social status

---

## Article III — Transactions

### III.1 All Transactions Require Fees

- Zero-fee systems create spam economies
- Fees are the immune system of the protocol

Transaction fees exist to:
- suppress abuse
- price scarce resources
- fund system sustainability

---

### III.2 Fees Are Consensus Costs

> In NYX, there are no free actions.
> There are only actions subsidized by the system.

Fees are not punishment.
Fees are the cost of changing shared state.

---

## Article IV — Web2 Wrapper Rule

### IV.1 Web2 Is Not Trusted

All Web2 data is assumed to be:
- mutable
- deletable
- censorable
- adversarial

---

### IV.2 All Web2 Access Must Be Wrapped by NYX

- Web2 may only act as an input layer
- State, credit, and decisions must be produced inside NYX

> Web2 is raw material.
> NYX is law.

---

## Article V — Decentralization Over Efficiency

- Abuse-resistance takes priority over UX and performance
- Any optimization that weakens decentralization is invalid

> Efficiency is temporary.
> Centralization is irreversible.

---

## Article VI — Technical Governance Principles

NYX is governed by the following technical axioms:

- modular architecture over monolithic systems
- verifiability over convenience
- security over speed
- explicit constraints over implicit trust

Governance mechanisms must be:
- on-chain
- auditable
- distributed
- self-healing

---

## Article VII — Credit & Identity Evolution

- Credit is generated exclusively from on-chain behavior
- Credit must be non-transferable
- Identity must support controlled evolution:
  - inheritance
  - freezing
  - multiplicity

> Reputation may be earned.
> It must never be bought.

---

## Article VIII — Web3 Law (Non-State)

- Law is expressed as code
- Law is executed by protocol
- Governance decisions carry legal force inside NYX

NYX law is:
- censorship-resistant
- self-executing
- independent of nation-states

Disputes are resolved via:
- protocol-defined rules
- community arbitration

> Code is law.
> Governance is legislation.
> Consensus is enforcement.

---

## Article IX — Glossary

**Identity**  
A structured set of permissions and credit bound to protocol rules

**Wallet**  
A replaceable key-management interface

**Transaction**  
A signed instruction that mutates shared state

**Credit**  
A non-transferable reputation derived from on-chain history

**Consensus Cost**  
The economic cost required to change shared state

*This Constitution is intentionally restrictive.*  
*Anything not explicitly permitted is structurally discouraged.*
